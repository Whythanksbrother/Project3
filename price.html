                <h3 class="texttop">Although it may seem like a scary pricepoint this is an very oportune price to spend on a modern machine. Spending the extra money now means saving a lot of money later.
                    hardware becomes obsolete as later and greater components come out making it hard to keep up with more modern games. Spending the extra money here insures that even if new parts were to come out for the next 6 years, you can easly throw thosee new parts in becasue of how
                    new these parts are. You can easily bring the overall price of this PC here by cutting costs on the CPU and GPU. Those being the most expensive components you can get a cheaper part but it will cost you the performace in your games or your daily tasks.
                    going with a less core less thread CPU in this situation could cut the price by maybe 50 to 100 dollars even. Going with a less modern graphics card is where you can expect to save a lot of money.
                    If you were to go with a couple year older GPU you could seriously save yourself maybe 200 dollars! While the price may be high you can see out good deals on used parts online and save even more money. I personally recommend this as it is somehting I have done in the past and has worked wonders in saving me big bucks!

                <h3>This is a simularly priced prebuilt pc meaning they did all the hard work for you. The downside of buying something like this is that you get less costing less performing parts since you have to pay for the labor. This PC specifically has a older motherboard worse GPU worse RAM and worse CPU which majorly impacts PC performance</h3>
