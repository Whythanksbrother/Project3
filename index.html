                <h3>Dispite what most may think, you can make a killer gaming PC that is pretty affordable and easy to build.
                    With this guide you'll be fully setup to buy parts. Ill show you what you should look out for and what to be aware of when building your first pc!
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    When building your first PC it can definitly be a scary endeavour but worry not as its not as bad as you think. The parts that we need for a pc are a Case, Motherboard, Graphics card, CPU, Ram, Storage, and a Power Supply!
                    It may seem like we need a lot of parts literally all of these parts will simply fall into place when your building it.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    Your CPU is your brain of your computer its the most crucial part, without it the PC wont do a thing.
                </h3>
                <h3 class="left">Your GPU is your whats going to allow you to display out to a monitor and make all your games look super good.
                </h3>
                <h3 class="left">Your case is what is going to house all of the parts that we buy. Cases are important but its where we will try and save the most money!
                </h3>
                <h3 class="left">Your storage is super important. If you put windows on a mechanical hard drive you may see windows running very slow even on a fast computer so picking the right part is crucial.
                </h3>
                <h3 class="left">Your Motherboard is what is going to hold all of your key components like you GPU and CPU. I know I said wihtout the CPU your computer cant do anything, well without a motherbaord you literally cant do anything because you cant plug anything in.
                </h3>
                <h3 class="left">Your Ram is whats going to keep some information that your system needs pre loaded in super fast memory so it doenst have to rely on your storage device so much
                </h3>
                <h3 class="left">Your power supply is what is going to give you PC parts all of the POWER that they need to run.
                </h3>
